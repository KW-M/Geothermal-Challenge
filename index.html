                    Today’s geothermal (aka hydrothermal power) is very limited because it requires a location with

                <p>
                    Enhanced Geothermal or EGS is a new technology that can make geothermal energy widely available by
                    creating underground reservoirs that allow water flow & heat extraction.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> In EGS, water is injected at high pressure into generally dry and impermeable rocks. </li>
                    <li> The pressure causes natural rock fractures to open.</li>
                    <li> These open fractures let circulating water absorb heat from the surrounding rock, making the
                        water
                        very hot. </li>
                    <li> At the surface, the boiling water turns into steam which drives an electric generator and
                        produces power. </li>
                    <li> After the water is cooled it gets pumped down a second well to be heated again and again in a
                        circular loop. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems-0">
                            [~] </a> </li>
                    <li> By not requiring highly specific geologic conditions, EGS expands the range of locations in
                        which geothermal can be developed. <a
                            href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems-0">[~]</a> </li>
                    <li> The DOE estimates that EGS can support tens of millions of house owners and businesses. <a
                            href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/enhanced-geothermal-systems-0">[~]</a> </li>
                    <li> EGS has major benefits over other energy sources. It’s very efficient, has a long service life,
                        and has many environmental benefits like emitting 99% less CO<sub>2</sub> than fossil fuel-based
                        power. <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36317.pdf">[~]</a> </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Why EGS is Safer than Fracking</h4>
                <p>EGS is often compared to fracking in the oil &amp; natural gas industry, but many differences
                    make EGS far safer and cleaner.</p>
                <h4>Oil &amp; Gas Fracking:</h4>
                <ol style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;">
                    <li>Uses
                        a pressurized mixture of water and chemicals to crack deep rock and extract oil
                        &amp; gas.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>Fracking
                        mixtures sometimes contaminate local groundwater. <a

                    <li>Residents

                    Modern geothermal technology like EGS & AGS use closed-loop systems that emit almost no greenhouse
                    gasses or pollutants.
                <ul>
                    <li>Greenhouse gasses like CO<sub>2</sub> & Methane (the main component of natural gas) rise into
                        the
                        atmosphere when we use fossil fuels. These gasses form an atmospheric “blanket” that causes our
                        planet to slowly heat up. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/">[~]</a> </li>
                    <li>The more gasses we emit, the more this process accelerates. The effects of this are becoming
                        very clear with the record breaking wildfires in the western US & intensifying storms & flooding
                        in the east. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/">[~]</a> </li>
                    <li>Geothermal is poised to play a key role in reducing CO<sub>2</sub> as well as smog & pollutants
                        that come
                        from burning fossil fuels which cause an estimated 3.6 million deaths worldwide every year -

                    </li>
                    <li>Each year, U.S. geothermal electricity offsets the emission of 4.1 million tons of
                        CO<sub>2</sub>, 80
                        thousand tons of nitrogen oxides, and 110 thousand tons of particulate matter that could have
                        been
                        released by coal-powered plants. <a

                    <li>Better still, scientists have found that geothermal systems can be used to store captured

                    Rain or shine, still or stormy, Geothermal keeps providing stable, clean power 24/7, 365 days a
                    year.
                <ul>
                    <li>Many renewables can’t provide power in certain conditions like solar at night & wind on a calm
                        summer's day. This inconsistent output is possibly the single biggest issue preventing full use
                        of renewables. </li>
                    <li>Inconsistency is an issue geothermal doesn’t have; making it one of the most reliable sources of
                        sustainable energy. </li>
                    <li>Geothermal can also solve demand spikes - for example when everyone flicks on the lights at
                        sunset. </li>
                    <li>Today, that spike in electricity is met by firing up highly inefficient & polluting gas-fired
                        “peaker” plants, so everyone’s lights don’t flicker. <a

                    <li>Geothermal solves this by using the earth as a heat battery. By reducing the flow rate through a
                        well, a geothermal plant can let extra heat build up in surrounding rock. When electricity
                        demand spikes, the geothermal plant can let the wells flow at full capacity converting the extra
                        stored heat directly into a surge of power to meet demand. </li>

                    Advanced Geothermal Systems or AGS bring many of the advantages of EGS but don’t need high-pressure
                    fracturing to allow water flow.
                <ul>

                    <li> AGS technologies use precision drilling to cut underground “U” shaped wells several Kilometers
                        on each side. </li>
                    <li> These wells function like a reverse radiator, pulling heat from the surrounding rock into a
                        water solution circulating through the sealed well. </li>
                    <li> If designed right, AGS wells need no pumps because the thermosyphon effect works to circulate
                        the water from heat alone. <a

                    </li>
                    <li> Because AGS has less surface area where water contacts the hot rock, AGS is better suited for
                        locations with lower power demand like small towns <a
                            href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">[~]</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> AGS technology is often combined with binary power generation. Binary generators transfer the
                        heat energy to a fluid with a lower boiling point than water, making them excellent for
                        converting lower temperature wells to electricity. </li>
                    <li> Binary generators can also be used alongside regular turbines in both AGS & EGS to increase
                        efficiency <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geovision">[~]</a>

                    Like all energy sources, geothermal takes water to build & run.
                <ul>

                    <li> In areas where water is plentiful, geothermal plants can take advantage of the increased
                        efficiency of water cooling. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geovision">[~]</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> In drier locals, air-cooled binary geothermal power plants use little to no water in operation
                        & can generate electricity from much lower temperatures. <a

                    </li>
                    <li> In EGS reservoir formation, plain water is pumped into the wells. Any available source of water
                        works, so drinking water supplies can be avoided as long as regulatory checks are put in place.

                    Geothermal runs on heat & people have applied this heat to a myriad of uses beyond generating
                    electricity.
                <ul>
                    <li> Extra heat from geothermal is great for district heating. In fact 85% of households in Iceland
                        have access to heating from geothermal wells. <a
                            href="https://www.government.is/topics/business-and-industry/energy/">[~]</a> </li>
                    <li> Using geothermal for electricity and heating has been shown to increase efficiency of a plant
                        to 70%. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geovision">[~]</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> That’s 150% more efficient than solar, & averages 90% more than coal. <a
                            href="https://ecsgeothermal.com/geothermal-energy-better-than-solar/">[~]</a> <a
                            href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geothermal-faqs">[~]</a> </li>
                    <li> Geothermal can also be used to mine valuable metals: Metals like lithium carbonate can be
                        extracted from well water. In the Salton Sea, California it’s estimated that 170,000 metric tons
                        of lithium can be extracted annually (Neupane and Wendt 2017). <a

                    </li>
                    <li> At a 2017 price, the Salton Sea lithium has the potential to supply the battery market with as
                        much as $2.3 billion annually in valuable materials <a

                    From drill operators to maintenance crews to geologists, many stand to benefit from good-paying jobs
                    in the burgeoning geothermal industry.
                <ul>
                    <li> Geothermal ventures need workers with many of the skills found in the oil & natural gas
                        industries and offer more long-term, better-paying local jobs. </li>
                    <li> According to the Department of Energy Geovision report, geothermal power plants can provide
                        more than double the long-term local jobs per powered household when compared to other
                        utility-scale power-generation technologies including wind, solar, and gas. <a

                    <li> Some figures from the oil and gas industry are arguing that Geothermal is an amazing
                        opportunity for the fossil fuel industry to switch to an environmentally friendly, stable, and
                        cost effective energy source. Geothermal has many of the same challenges and solutions as
                        drilling in oil and gas meaning oil companies could use their existing talent and investments
                        while staying profitable and dramatically cutting their environmental impact & negative image in
                        the public eye. <a

                    Deep EGS is the final frontier of geothermal power. Deep EGS wells can go to depths past 5, 7 or
                    even 9 km to generate heat and electricity anywhere efficiently.
                <ul>
                    <li> Below 7-10 km in the earth’s crust, temperatures are hot enough to produce electricity nearly
                        anywhere. <a
                            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121007082347/http://smu.edu/geothermal/GeothermalMap/geothermalmap.html">[~]</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> In already warm areas, deep EGS can tap supercritical water - water that’s neither liquid nor
                        gas. When water becomes supercritical, it’s energy per volume jumps by a factor of 4 and almost
                        doubles the efficiency of turbine generators. <a
                            href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/10/21/21515461/renewable-energy-geothermal-egs-ags-supercritical">[~]</a>
                    </li>
                    <li> Several deep EGS test projects are happening around the world. In the U.S. the DOE-funded Utah
                        FORGE site is constructing an 8km deep egs system to show Deep EGS can work, and work safely.
                        More deep test wells are being drilled in Italy & Iceland to show Deep EGS can be safe in many
                        parts of the world. </li>
                    <li> Drilling costs are the biggest hurdle to making deep egs commercially viable. Drilling to these
                        depths can cost between 20 million & 400 million dollars with no guarantee heat or permeability
                        at the bottom will be sufficient. </li>
                    <li> If a breakthrough in low-cost drilling arrives, Deep EGS will lead to a new era of geothermal
                        usage by utilizing hotter reservoirs at greater depths. </li>
                    <li> With technological improvements, deep EGS could be powering 57% of all renewable US electricity
                        generation by 2050. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geovision">[~]

                    The DOE, industry and others are making huge strides in developing better & cheaper drilling

                    <li> Hydrothermal Spallation Drilling (HSD) is a new form of drilling for hard and brittle rocks.
                        HSD can reduce costs by 15-20% by rapid heating of rock surfaces which allows for the expansion
                        of solid rock under stress. <a

                    Installing geothermal today costs about double that of wind, solar, and hydropower, but its high
                    efficiency makes up the difference.
                <ul>
                    <li> Geothermal is extremely efficient once installed and it does not require constant input like
                        fossil fuel-based power. </li>
                    <li> Geothermal’s efficiency brings down the price of power to 7.8-22.5¢ per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in
                        2016 - less than electricity costs from solar power. <a
                            href="http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/geothermal-energy-factsheet"> </a> </li>
                    <li> 24% to 50% or more of the high upfront cost of a geothermal plant comes from the drilling and
                        reservoir formation steps with drilling costs increasing exponentially for greater depths. <a

                    <li> This lack of guaranteed profits makes geothermal very unattractive to potential investors and
